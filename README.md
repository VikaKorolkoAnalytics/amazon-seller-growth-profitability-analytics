## 🏗️ Solution Architecture
[![Solution Architecture](./1_architecture/solution_archtecture.png)](./1_architecture/solution_archtecture.png)
The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end data pipeline, from raw data ingestion through ETL, SQL modeling, analytical reporting, and Power BI Service deployment.

- Raw data ingested from Amazon Sales, Amazon Ads, and Meta Ads CSV exports.
- Power Query used for ETL, data cleansing, and transformation.
- SQL staging layer supports initial and incremental monthly data loads.
- Hybrid Star Schema model implemented to support scalable analytical reporting.
- Power BI Semantic Model contains reusable DAX measures, KPI calculations, and Time Intelligence logic.
- Report deployed to Power BI Service using Import Mode.

## 📂 Data Sources
The solution integrates data from multiple ecommerce data sources:
- Amazon Sales exports
- Amazon Advertising exports
- Meta Advertising exports

To demonstrate the data structure and reporting workflow, a subset of source files is included in this repository:
- 3 Amazon Sales sample files
- 3 Amazon Advertising sample files
- 1 Meta Advertising sample file

Raw files are provided for educational and portfolio purposes. Brand-specific identifiers have been excluded from the published project.

Additional source files are available via [Google Drive]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AND9cY_Zr5OKwUMH2Q_f9Ml89IDLZYZD?usp=sharing)

## 🔄 Power Query ETL
Power Query was used to automate data ingestion, cleansing, and transformation before loading data into the SQL staging layer.

Each source system (Amazon Sales, Amazon Ads, and Meta Ads) was ingested and transformed independently, ensuring consistent schemas, reliable downstream processing, and clear separation of business logic.

Amazon Sales and Amazon Ads datasets were processed using the Folder + Function pattern. Transformation logic was implemented once as a reusable function and automatically applied to all monthly source files within each folder.

### Power Query Workflows
The following screenshots illustrate the Power Query implementation and transformation workflows used for each source system.

```

### Key Transformations
- Standardized column names and schemas across source files.
- Applied data type validation and conversion.
- Added source system metadata for data lineage tracking.
- Removed duplicate records and invalid rows.
- Created clean staging datasets for SQL Server loading.

### Output
Data from Amazon Sales, Amazon Ads, and Meta Ads reports was transformed in Power Query and exported as staging staging datasets:
- `stg_amazon_sales`
- `stg_amazon_ads`
- `stg_meta_ads`

Additional information and access to the staging datasets are available in the [Staging data](./4_staging_data/staging_data.md).

These staging datasets were subsequently loaded into SQL Server and served as the foundation for dimensional modeling, Hybrid Star Schema design, and Power BI reporting.

## 🗄️ SQL Data Modeling
SQL Server was used to implement the staging layer, dimensional model, fact tables, and incremental loading process.

### SQL Workflow

```
### Data Modeling Process
- Created SQL staging tables for Amazon Sales, Amazon Ads, and Meta Ads datasets.
- Performed data validation after each load, including row counts, data type verification, NULL checks, and duplicate detection.
- Built dimension and mapping tables for Products, Locations, Campaigns, and States.
- Generated the Date Dimension to support Time Intelligence calculations.
- Created fact tables for Sales, Returns, Amazon Ads, and Meta Ads.
- Implemented referential integrity through dimensional modeling and surrogate keys.
- Performed post-load validation and reconciliation between staging and fact tables.

### Data Refresh Strategy
The solution supports incremental monthly updates without reloading the entire dataset.

- New monthly source files are automatically processed through existing Power Query transformations.
- Clean staging files are loaded into SQL Server.
- New dimension members are inserted when required.
- New fact records are loaded only when they do not already exist.
- Duplicate prevention is implemented using NOT EXISTS validation logic.
- Source file tracking is maintained through the `source_file` attribute to support auditability and data lineage.
